mallochook
==========

An example for `LD_PRELOAD` based library function hooking.

There are two source code files, `program.c` and `mallochook.c` in this
repository.  `program.c` is source code for a simple program using `malloc()`
and `free()`, that will be hooked.  `mallochook.c` implements the functions
that will be called instead of `malloc()` and `free()`.


Usage
=====

Below command will build necessary binaries and execute the example program
with hooking:

```
$ make run_hooked
```


Below command will build necessary binaries and execute the example program
without hooking:

```
$ make run_unhooked
```


For more detail, `Use the code` ;)
