mallochook
==========

An example for `LD_PRELOAD` based library function hooking.

There is two source code files, `program.c` and `mallochook.c`.
`program.c` is a source code for a simple program using `malloc()` and
`free()`.  `mallochook.c` implements the functions that will be called instead
of `malloc()` and `free()` by the hooking.


Usage
=====

Below command will build necessary binaries and execute the example program
with hooking:

`$ make run_hooked`


Below command will build necessary binaries and execute the example program
without hooking:

`$ make run_unhooked`


For more detail, `Use the code` ;)
